# An Introduction to ZForum

## What is ZForum?

ZForum is a forum software powered by [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/), and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). ZForum is designed to look great, be customisable, and be easy to use. It also comes with many Artisan CLI commands to make setup quick and easy.

Want to get started? Go to the [setup guide](./setup-guide).

## Why choose ZForum

### Functional

ZForum contains all of the basic functions for a forum: creating and updating posts, creating subposts (known internally as comments) under posts, as well as having replies for subposts.

### Customisable

With [Roles](/docs/roles), you can decide exactly what different users can do. You can also configure the theme in the themes.json file

### Markdown-enabled Posts

Users can create posts containing markdown, and the Create Post page contains a markdown editor,
as well as a preview, thanks to Codemirror.
